This project aims to make bite marks useful for getting class evidence by using image recognition to determine specific features of a bite mark (bite force (N), Alterior Teeth Width (mm), and Alterior Teeth Depth (mm))
It then takes these features and runs it into a Polynomial Regression model in order to generate and predict class data of potential suspects.

Bite marks are currently incapable of being used to identify suspects due to various factors such as no standard protocol and lots of experimenter bias. This Bite Mark Analysis Framework (BMAF) aims to combat that.
